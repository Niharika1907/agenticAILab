My name is Niharika Manga. I'm a Senior DevOps Engineer, originally from India, now living in Canada.
I'm passionate about building scalable, reliable infrastructure and automating everything I can.
Outside of work, I love traveling, enjoying pizza and pasta, and playing badmintonâ€”a perfect day involves exploring new places or cultures, followed by a great meal and a good game.
